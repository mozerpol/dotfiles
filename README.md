## Configs-Settings
I'm a user of linux based systems, so it's natural to use the cli apps sometimes.
Because of this I have a problem to remember every shortcut. So I created this
repo to save my own configs and (if it's necessary) list the most important for 
me shortcuts.
_____________

1. [*Conky*](https://github.com/mozerpol/Configs-Settings/tree/master/conky) - lightweight desktop system monitor
2. [*NeoVim*](https://github.com/mozerpol/Configs-Settings/tree/master/neoVim) - *Vim* fork
3. [*Translate Shell*](https://github.com/mozerpol/Configs-Settings/tree/master/translateShell) - translator in cli
4. [Other files](https://github.com/mozerpol/Configs-Settings/tree/master/otherFiles) - other files, the description of which is so short that I didn't 
create a separate folder for them, e.g. *grip*
5. [*mps-youtube*](https://github.com/mozerpol/Configs-Settings/tree/master/tmux) - youtube in cli
6. [*tmux*](https://github.com/mozerpol/Configs-Settings/tree/master/tmux) - terminal multiplexer

Why the name of this repo is *"dotfiles"* not "myconfig" or "settings"? <br/>
Because is very popular that when we're personalizing various programs, their
configuration files start from dot. So we can say that config files are
**dot**-**files**, for example config file for *tmux* will be "*.tmux.conf*". <br/>
