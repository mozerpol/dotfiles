### How to install
`apt install conky` <br/>
It's worth to consider: <br/>
`apt install conky-all`

To run *conky*: <br/>
`conky`

Then should appear: <br/>

To get rid of the flicker run: <br/>
`conky -b`

### Important directories/files:
1. */etc/conky* - Conky main folder
2. */etc/conky/conky.conf* - Conky configuration file
3. */etc/xdg/autostart* - Folder for autostart files

### How to run Conky at startup
It depends on graphics environment. For *Mate*:
Inside folder */etc/xdg/autostart* put two files: <br/>
- conky-startup.sh - also run command `sudo chmod a+x conky-startup.sh`.
- conky.desktop

##### Files content:
*conky-startup.sh*: <br/>
```bash
sleep 10 && conky -b
```

*conky.desktop* <br/>
```bash
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Exec=/etc/xdg/autostart/conky-startup.sh
Hidden=false
NoDisplay=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
Name[en_US]=conky
Name=conky
Comment[en_US]=desktop system monitor
Comment=desktop system monitor
```

### conky_old_version.conf
About ten years ago (Â± 2012) in high school I made my own config. Unfortunately
with newer version of *conky* the syntax has changed. Luckily, I once took a
screenshot). <br/>
So... my old config is called *conky_old_version.conf* <br/>
![screemshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43972902/125206490-dfe94080-e287-11eb-92a2-1340d16c9b29.jpg)

In the screenshot you can see also terminal emulator *tilda* and simple
terminal.

### TODO
Create a new version of my own config using new syntax. I'll do it, but later...
